**Feedback:**
1. **Explain how the canister could be improved:**
    - **Modularization:** The code could benefit from better modularization. Consider breaking down the code into smaller functions or modules for better readability, maintainability, and reusability.

    - **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling by providing more informative error messages, including details about the context of the error. This can help developers troubleshoot issues more effectively.

    - **Documentation:** Add inline comments to explain complex logic, especially in functions where the workflow is not immediately clear. Good documentation is crucial for the maintainability of the code.

    - **Validation:** Consider adding more comprehensive validation logic, especially in functions like `add_hospital` and `add_patient`, where user inputs are accepted.

2. **State technical problems of code or explanations:**
    - **Thread-Local Usage:** Be cautious about using thread-local static variables excessively. While they are useful in some cases, they can make the code harder to reason about and test. Consider alternative patterns, like passing dependencies explicitly.

    - **Error Handling Consistency:** Ensure consistent error handling throughout the code. For instance, the `Result` type is used in some functions, but others use `unwrap` directly. Stick to a consistent error-handling approach.

    - **Default Password Handling:** In several places, default passwords are set to a simple hyphen ("-"). This might be a security concern, and it's recommended to use more secure practices for handling passwords.

**Additional Comments:**
- Consider providing default implementations for some traits like `Default` to avoid boilerplate code. This can simplify the code and reduce redundancy.

- Check if the `validator` crate is necessary for your use case. If not, you might want to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

- Ensure that the exposed functions through the Candid interface are appropriately documented for users who interact with the canister.

- Test the code thoroughly, especially the error-handling scenarios, to ensure robustness.
